# Django Dodo

This is an email utility that I was previously working on and decided to add to GitHub. In
it's current format, it is not functional. However, hopefully this will soon change.

The general idea of this was to create an email marketing and communication system that
can be used as a replacement for some of the paid services you can find out there. When finished,
this app should be able to:

- Send emails through your specified email service
- Allow an admin user to create feature rich emails 
- Track clicks for a user email
- Track "reads" of a user email
- Track bounced emails
- Display statistics of user emails


## Pre-requisites

You will need a Django project to install this into.


## TODO Items

This application has very few tests as I was trying to get the general layout
for this service. However, with the size and complexity new items should have
corresponding tests.
